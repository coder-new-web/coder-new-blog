`We'd wander streets at night - even parks - and never once felt threatened though we were both in our late 60s.`  
我们晚上会在街上漫步，甚至在公园里漫步，尽管我们都已经 60 多岁了，但从未感到受到威胁。

`Even my little village I was born in the 40s with very few people in it was Never as safe as China. Even in their big cities this has so much to do with Chinese people's character they are Peaceful by nature they always try to avoid troubles and this is the sign of intelligence they are also very forgiving by nature and the best people to get along with`  
即使是我出生于 40 年代的小村庄，人口很少，也从未像中国那样安全。即使在大城市，这也与中国人的性格有很大关系，他们生性和平，总是尽量避免麻烦。这是聪明的标志，他们生性非常宽容，是最好相处的人。

`Please don't praise and publicize our China's development to any country and people, we just want to grow silently and humblely!`  
请不要向任何国家和人民赞扬和宣传我们中国的发展，我们只想默默地、谦卑地成长！

`Actually found out the street is pretty lively. There were street sweepers, night hawkers, people playing chess, etc.`  
实际上发现这条街还蛮热闹的。有扫街的人、夜里的小贩、下棋的人等等。

`Less bias, less fake news, more communication and love`  
少一点偏见，少一点假新闻，多一点沟通和爱

`I'm totally blown away`  
彻底被震惊了

`see just how far China has come`  
看看中国已经走了多远

`Keep up the great work`  
继续努力

`Nothing pleasant walking in downtown anymore`  
在市中心散步再也没有什么愉快的事了
